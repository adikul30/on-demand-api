# on-demand-api

### What is it ?
<hr>
Fully managed CRUD(for now) API service. 

### Why use it ?
<hr>
No need to handle a __database, a server or an API__. <br>
REST endpoints for basic CRUD operations with personalised schema within seconds (No need to wait for the backend guy in the team :P). 

### Use Case ?
<hr>
Application developers (app and web) looking to quickly prototype an application. <br>
Testing out networking logic on app side. 

### How to use it ?
<hr>
Name your endpoint and upload your schema as a JSON. <br>
That's it. 

### Progress
